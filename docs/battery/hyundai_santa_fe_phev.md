ℹ️ Note, the P-CAN and H-CAN networks need to be joined together. The Battery-Emulator needs to send messages towards both CAN buses for the battery to be able to close contactors.

Connect the following:

- P/H-CAN High - To CAN-H on the board
- P/H-CAN Low - To CAN-L on the board
- Pin 1 & 2 - To 12V supply
- Pin 3 & 14 - Short together by installing the Service Plug
- Pin 33 & 32 - To GND for 12V supply
- Pin 12 - To 12V Supply (this is the wakeup signal)
